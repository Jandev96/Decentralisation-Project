          <p className=" leading-relaxed">
            Gram Panchayats are pivotal in fostering participatory democracy and rural development by empowering local communities to engage in decision-making and resource management. They plan and execute development projects, provide essential services, and address social issues, ensuring initiatives align with village-specific needs. This study examines local governance, public participation, and service delivery in rural Kerala, offering insights into the strengths and challenges of grassroots democracy through empirical analysis of villagers’ awareness, engagement, and satisfaction.
